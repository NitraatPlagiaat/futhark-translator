# Futhark Translator

Futhark Translator translates Latin readable text to correct Elder Futhark runes.

## What is Elder Futhark

Elder Futhark is the oldest human writing system of the Germanic language family mostly used by the Northwest Germanic folks living in what now is known as Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Iceland.
Elder Futhark has been used from the 2nd to the 8th century until it was changed to Younger Futhark used by the vikings. In the same period, The ANglo-Saxons and Frisians made their own
version of Younger Futhark called Anglo-Saxon Futhorc.

## Important to know about Elder Futhark

While it is possible to translate sentences in your language to Elder Futhark, Elder Futhark itself is actually not compatible with our current Alphabet.
The reason I say it is possible, is that it comes close to our Alphabet, but some letters we use do not appear in Elder Futhark and vice versa with runes in the modern Alphabet.

You may have spotted the word "correct" in the main title of this text. And that is because most rune translators are not always correctly translating.
So here are some Elder Futhark writing rules listed for you.

- Vowels are written once at a time (e.g. "beer" becomes "ber" written in EF).
- Elder Futhark is completely based on phonetics (e.g. "You" becomes "Juw" written in EF).

The above is what I mostly don't see in online rune translators what. Points below are nice to know about EF but won't be in the program (yet)

- Words are written right after each other without spaces
- Sometimes, runes are combined with each other making bindrunes (e.g. The bluetooth logo after king Harald Bluetooth of Denmark in the 10th century)
- Runes can be written from left to right, but also from right to left.
- Sometimes folks added a protectionrune behind the word they have written. Mostly out of religious beliefs.
